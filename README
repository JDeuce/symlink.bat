LINKING IN WINDOWS VISTA / WINDOWS 7:
-----------------------------------------
In windows vista and windows 7, you can create native symlinks.

The command is slightly different for directories and files:
	Directory: mklink /d link_name directory_name
	File: mklink link_name file_name

Note that by default mklink requires administrator privileges. If you want to make them as a limited user you can use secpol.msc and add your user to Local Policies -> User Rights Assignment -> Create symbolic links. 

LINKING IN WINDOWS XP
----------------------
For windows xp, creating links is more of a pain.

To make directory links, you can use the junction utility from here: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896768. 

I couldn't find a way to make symbolic file links in XP, however, I did find how to make hardlinks, and they're almost just as good. Changing the original still changes the link, the difference is deleting the original does not delete the link. 

Windows xp link commands:
	Directory: junction link_name directory_name
	File: fsutil hardlink create link_name file_name 


CAN'T SOMEONE SIMPLIFY ALL THIS TO ONE COMMAND?
-----------------------------
symlink.bat lets you create directory and file links with one command on all operating systems with the following syntax:
	symlink original_name linked_name

WINDOWS VISTA/WINDOWS 7 INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
-----------------------------------------------
Just drop symlink.bat into C:\windows\system32.
Be sure you run the batch as an administrator, or enable the Create Symbolic Links privilege for your user.

WINDOWS XP INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
---------------------------------
Edit the top of the batch to set xp=true.
Download junction from here: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896768
Drop both symlink.bat and junction.exe into C:\windows\system32.
